# @cblackcom/front

My personal web app front-end starter kit.  
Start developing a modern React app quickly, with minimal configuration.

* React
* SASS
* [Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com)
* [Bootstrap Reboot](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/reboot/)
* Asset cache busting without using a dynamic scripting language

It's similar to the idea behind [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev), but way slimmed down and ready for customization with no `eject` process.  Just install, and then fire up a local dev serverâ€”

```bash
npm run hot
```

You did it.  Cheers.  ðŸ¥ƒ

## Installation

You don't need to check this repo out.

If you don't already have modern node on your machine, grab it with `nvm`
https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

Then create a new projectâ€”

```bash
# Create and enter a new directory for your project
mkdir my-new-project
cd my-new-project

# Go
npx github:cblackcom/front
```

After installation, check out the `README.md` in your new project for the last couple of things.
