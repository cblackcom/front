This is my opinionated AI prompt for creating a fresh React web application, and is our reference baseline at [PNDLM](https://pndlm.com) for new modern web apps.  It is based on the [Vite](https://vite.dev) team's excellent `react-ts` template.

- React
- Emotion
- Redux Toolkit
- React Router
- Font Awesome

## Instructions

Create a new git repo or `cd` to the one you already have—
```bash
mkdir new-project
cd new-project
git init
```

Now, aim Claude Code at it and say—

```text
Claude, please create a new web application according to the prompt located at https://github.com/cblackcom/front/blob/main/PROMPT.md
```

Enjoy!
